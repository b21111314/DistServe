/*
  Note:  CUTLASS 3x increases the host compiler requirements to C++17. However, certain
         existing integrations of CUTLASS require C++11 host compilers.

         Until this requirement can be lifted, certain headers with this annotation are required
         to be remain consistent with C++11 syntax.

         C++11 compatibility is enforced by this unit test: `cutlass_test_unit_core_cpp11`.
